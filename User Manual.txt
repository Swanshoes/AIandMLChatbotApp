1. Project is built as an in-browser App.
2. Bot can be launched from the Ctrl + F5 within Visual Studio or hitting either play button.
3. Hit the Chatbot link in banner on top of welcome page.
4. Upload training data to make certain the model has been built. Training data has been included in root App_Data folder. Either csv will work.
5. Type questions into the "Ask a question here..." box and hit submit. This will produce an answer from the bot along with a confidence score.
6. To test the upload function, upload the other set of training questions from App_Data. This should give a "New dataset uploaded and model retrained successfully."
New questions can then be submitted to the model.
